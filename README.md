# ImgView4Windows
 Tiny program that opens images like photos, just smaller and hopefully more pleasant (I do not like photos app)
# BUILDING
IF YOU WANT TO BUILD THIS FOR SOME REASON, YOU NEED RAYLIB AND RAYGUI IN "src/include" AND LIBRAYLIB IN "src/libs"
Only works in windows, though. It's probably easy enough to compile for Linux, just make sure you change the flags
in the makefile and use the Linux equivalent of windres (Or completely ignore the resource files it'll work fine without it).
